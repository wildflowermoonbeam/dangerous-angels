        <p>putting the final touches on version 8.1 of the zine. some notes about my process:
        <ul>
            <li>i always create zine layouts by hand. the text is (usually) typed and printed from a computer but otherwise it's a manual process.</li>
            <li>i did my best to find a font that replicates the original font i used on heartshaped #1, which i published in 2004. the copy for that zine was written on our home computer (the same one i was making websites on at the time!) and most likely printed at home, then photocopied for free in the rec center room my girl scout troop met in.</li>
            <li>i was very mindful of my paper usage with my first zine - probably a combination of my natural tendency to conserve materials, and the general atmosphere of scrimping and saving in our house - so the paper i used for the base of my masters was reused from school assignments. i used the same strategy here: the base is made of printouts of my thesis paper. i'm curious to see if any of the text will ghost through when photocopied.</li>
            <li>beds are always a great additional workspace.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I haven't dug too much into the culture of BBS that facilitated a lot of the community amongst website builders. I was a member of this one in 2002, when I was 16 years old. The domain (pink-mafia.com) that hosted this one, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021209050932/http://www.pink-mafia.com/bbs/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi" target="_blank">playground BBS</a>, was owned by a friend of a friend. as I recall they all pretty much looked like this, I believe there were a couple of different services that would provide plug n play CGI that girls would then install on their domains. (for example this one links to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021128053622/http://www.ikonboard.com/" target="_blank">ikonboard.com</a>)

        <p>one interesting thing is the name: we all called these BBSs, an acronym for "bulletin board system," but this acronym actually refers to a much earlier technology that dates back to the 70s. I'm not sure how it carried over to be the name of choice for forums populated by teen girls troubleshooting each other's HTML problems.

        <p><img src="blogimages/playgroundwww.png" width="428" height="137">

        <p>I mentioned this in my paper, but something I want to continue to explore further is this culture of girls learning how to code from each other. This starts with <a href="http://lissaexplains.com/lissa.shtml" target="_blank">Lissa Explains</a> and I've also found some examples of girls crediting their friends with layout help on archived websites.

        <p>also: of course I moderated the pen pal board.

        <p>i'm working on my arts research this evening and putting together some zine pages. i went through the pages that i made back in the fall (when cathy asked us to "make something" for homework) and pulled out the ones that still seemed relevant, but then i realized, since this process is supposed to be iterative, why not remix the other pages i made before?

            <p><img src="blogimages/palimpsest.jpg" width=“400” height="300">

        <p>what i'm doing right now is taking text from some of the archived websites i found, and cut n pasting it into my own zine pages. the ethics of this is super interesting because stealing other peoples' graphics, layouts, or content was a huge deal at this time (it might be interesting to reflect on how that's changed, or not, with platforms like tiktok that are designed for remixing and iterating on other peoples' work).

        <p>something else that is fascinating me is the use of the word "content" to describe what we put on our sites, because that's such a jargon-y word and we were using it as 14-year-olds in 2000. now the word is commonplace, but i think of it as a social media concept. i'm also curious about the origin of the term "splash page," which everyone in the subculture used.

        <p>{it is really cool to experience the effects of arts research. creating the work enables a flow state which naturally prompts meditation on the topic at hand and leads to new topics of curiosity..}

        <p align="justify">Today I was having a conversation with a high school student at my student teaching placement, I mentioned that I'm working on a thesis as part of my grad school work and she asked what it's about. I felt sort of weird explaining that it was about teen girls learning to code, so I just said that it's about making personal websites in the early 2000s (which is also true). She had also asked what artistic mediums I work in, which is such a fantastic question, and I talked about how I've been building this website as part of my artistic practice and she questioned how making a website is artistic (not in a negative way, genuinely curious). It's a really cool question to ponder especially in terms of what the web looks like today. Based on her age it can be assumed that she primarily interacts with web 2.0 (socially connected platforms and apps, rather than the more static websites of web 1.0). Thru my artistic research I really have come to view creating this website as an iterative artistic practice, terms that I didn't have when I was 15 but I do think I was working in a similar spirit back then.

        <p><img src="blogimages/pixellespicks.png" width="500">

        <p>it may seem benign - we'll make it easy for you! - but the effect is to leave us helpless consumers, unable to build anything for ourselves (teen girls and grad students alike). i'm excited to dig into a lot of ideas i have about the ability to code as a form of currency.

        <p>and i'm thrilled to have found a hosting solution that's so simple. i write the code in a simple text editor on my local hard drive, then upload it to my github repository. i've never used github before tonight, and tbh it makes me feel like a master coding genius, even though i don't understand half of the terminology and i'm just clicking around and trying stuff out like i'm 12 again. but hey, i got a website live in under an hour!

        <p>speaking of which, still some broken links and broken images bc i'm trying to figure out how to replicate my folder hierarchy in github. hang in there with me!

        <p align="justify">something interesting that i'm noticing as i continue to organize my "document collection": most of the sites i've gathered so far are from 2001-2002. {for context, i was age 14-16 during this time period.} was this the heyday of the subculture? is this simply because the sites themselves had a short lifespan, so all the other sites they link to also existed during the same contemporary time? or did i simply save sites that i personally remembered when i was doing my initial document search?

        <p align="justify">some observations as i flail around coding today:
            <br>♡ ok at first I was like, "oh god i don't want to code a webpage," but as I committed to it, i really got back into the flow, and found that remembered pleasure in tweaking the code and refreshing the browser again and again, hoping to see that it worked
            <br>♡ briefly had ptsd-like flashbacks to being 12 and struggling to figure out why the pictures weren't showing up on the web browser. (back then, it was bc i was linking to local files on a published www page. today, it was because i was using textedit and didn't realize saving the page as html saved my rich text as a webpage [why would anyone even want to do that?]. using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">visual studio code</a> now. god i love creative problem solving.)
            <br>♡ this research journal is turning out to involve a lot more technical stuff than expected! i imagine that will change once i delve into some of the more analog art-making processes. but also, i think it's so cool that I'm really committing to this old school digital artmaking process that used to be so intrinsic to my practice. so so excited to see where it all takes me.

        <p>today I started thinking about how I want to organize the document collection; actually today I feel like I’m doing a million things at once. I made a collage/journal entry reflecting on some ideas I had at the <a href="https://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/salem-witch-trials-reckoning-and-reclaiming" target="_blank">"salem witch trials” exhibit</a> that I saw with melissa yesterday. I need to start organizing the document collection (right now it’s a mess in my bookmarks and a bunch of screenshots) but to do that I needed a repository, so I had to make the website, which is this obviously - but I have to design it first, which means coding html for the first time in years.

        <p>[obviously I don’t have to make a website from scratch, but for this inquiry, I prefer to]

        <p>[also full disclosure, it hasn’t been that long since I coded html – I had a pretty serious neopets re-obsession from 2020-2021, basically until flash was made obsolete]
