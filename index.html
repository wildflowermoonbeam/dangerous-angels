        <p align="justify">something interesting that i'm noticing as i continue to organize my "document collection": most of the sites i've gathered so far are from 2001-2002. {for context, i was age 14-16 during this time period.} was this the heyday of the subculture? is this simply because the sites themselves had a short lifespan, so all the other sites they link to also existed during the same contemporary time? or did i simply save sites that i personally remembered when i was doing my initial document search?

        <p align="justify">finally getting into organizing the document collection stuff tonight. created a page with a very basic iframe layout (subject to change, like all layouts!) and it's so enjoyable to go through the coding process. the dopamine hit when you refresh the page and get exactly what you were hoping for !!

        <p align="justify">some observations as i flail around coding today:
            <br>♡ ok at first I was like, "oh god i don't want to code a webpage," but as I committed to it, i really got back into the flow, and found that remembered pleasure in tweaking the code and refreshing the browser again and again, hoping to see that it worked
            <br>♡ briefly had ptsd-like flashbacks to being 12 and struggling to figure out why the pictures weren't showing up on the web browser. (back then, it was bc i was linking to local files on a published www page. today, it was because i was using textedit and didn't realize saving the page as html saved my rich text as a webpage [why would anyone even want to do that?]. using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">visual studio code</a> now. god i love creative problem solving.)
            <br>♡ this research journal is turning out to involve a lot more technical stuff than expected! i imagine that will change once i delve into some of the more analog art-making processes. but also, i think it's so cool that I'm really committing to this old school digital artmaking process that used to be so intrinsic to my practice. so so excited to see where it all takes me.

        <p align="justify">testing 1 2 3 :P

        <p>today I started thinking about how I want to organize the document collection; actually today I feel like I’m doing a million things at once. I made a collage/journal entry reflecting on some ideas I had at the <a href="https://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/salem-witch-trials-reckoning-and-reclaiming" target="_blank">"salem witch trials” exhibit</a> that I saw with melissa yesterday. I need to start organizing the document collection (right now it’s a mess in my bookmarks and a bunch of screenshots) but to do that I needed a repository, so I had to make the website, which is this obviously - but I have to design it first, which means coding html for the first time in years.

        <p>[obviously I don’t have to make a website from scratch, but for this inquiry, I prefer to]

        <p>[also full disclosure, it hasn’t been that long since I coded html – I had a pretty serious neopets re-obsession from 2020-2021, basically until flash was made obsolete]

        <p><img src="blogimages/desk-setup-01152023.jpg" width=“400” height="300">

        <p>that’s my current desk setup btw. viewing page sources just like in the old days!
