    the screenshots in this section have been collected from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank">wayback machine</a> on the internet archive.
    <p><b>p r o c e s s :</b> my process to find these sites was to start with a few URLs I remembered (letsbefriends.org and loverevolution.net). from there, I used the same process that one would historically use to discover new websites: I followed links to other sites. many websites were not fully archived, resulting in broken links and broken images.</p>
    <p><b>n a v i g a t i o n :</b> clicking on the dates in the menu on the left will show a screenshot of the website captured on that date. clicking on the [ x ] will bring you to the archived page on the wayback machine.</p>
    <p><b>s c o p e :</b> websites featured here were live between 2000-2009 and, to the best of my knowledge, were created by teen girls (ages 12-19). due to my method of document collection and the limitations of the wayback machine, this in no way represents the entirety of websites created at that time, but instead serves to reflect the internet as i personally remembered it from this historic time period.</p>
    <p><b>*</b> websites denoted with an asterisk were created by me in the early 2000s.</p>
